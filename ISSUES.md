### Issue #6: Port `lib/amm.ts` to ethers (contract bindings)
**Status:** ❌ PENDING  
**Labels:** `frontend`, `critical`, `blocking`, `contract-integration`  
**Priority:** HIGH

**Description:**
Implement ethers contract wrappers to call AMM contract functions and read events. The current `lib/amm.ts` has generic factory/router functions, but needs to be updated to work directly with the AMM contract interface.

**Current State:**
- Generic factory/router functions exist
- AMM ABI is available at `src/lib/abi/AMM.json`
- Pages expect functions that work with the AMM contract directly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `getAllPools(contractAddress, provider)` - Reads PoolCreated events from AMM contract
- [ ] `getPool(poolId, contractAddress, provider)` - Reads pool data using `getPool(bytes32)` function
- [ ] `createPool(tokenA, tokenB, amountA, amountB, contractAddress, signer)` - Calls AMM's `createPool` function
- [ ] `addLiquidity(poolId, amount0, amount1, contractAddress, signer)` - Calls AMM's `addLiquidity` function
- [ ] `removeLiquidity(poolId, liquidity, contractAddress, signer)` - Calls AMM's `removeLiquidity` function
- [ ] `swap(poolId, tokenIn, amountIn, minAmountOut, recipient, contractAddress, signer)` - Calls AMM's `swap` function
- [ ] `getUserLiquidity(poolId, userAddress, contractAddress, provider)` - Calls AMM's `getLpBalance` function
- [ ] All functions return expected types matching the contract interface
- [ ] Functions handle errors appropriately
- [ ] Contract address configuration via environment variable (see Technical Notes)

**Technical Notes:**
- AMM contract uses `bytes32 poolId` (not address)
- PoolCreated event signature: `PoolCreated(bytes32 indexed poolId, address indexed token0, address indexed token1, uint16 feeBps, ...)`
- Contract functions use different signatures than factory/router pattern
- Need to use ABI from `src/lib/abi/AMM.json`
- **Contract Address:** The AMM contract will be deployed and the address will be provided. Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_AMM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` environment variable. Do not hardcode contract addresses.

**Blocking:**
This issue blocks all contract interaction features (swap, pools, liquidity management).

### Issue #7: Swap Component — Contract Integration
**Status:** ❌ PENDING  
**Labels:** `frontend`, `feature`, `swap`  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Depends on:** #6

**Description:**
Port `src/app/swap/page.tsx` to use the new contract helpers and wallet signer to send swap transactions. The UI exists but uses mock data and generic router functions.

**Current State:**
- UI exists at `/swap` route
- Uses mock token data
- Has quote estimation logic
- Submit button calls generic `amm.swap()` function

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can select tokens from available pools
- [ ] User enters amount to swap
- [ ] Component calculates estimated output using pool reserves
- [ ] Component shows slippage protection
- [ ] User can submit swap transaction
- [ ] Transaction is sent to AMM contract's `swap` function
- [ ] Success/failure feedback displayed
- [ ] Transaction receipt shown
- [ ] Pool reserves update after swap

**Technical Notes:**
- Need to fetch available pools first
- Calculate swap output using constant product formula: `amountOut = (amountIn * reserveOut) / (reserveIn + amountIn)`
- Apply fee: `amountInWithFee = amountIn * (10000 - feeBps) / 10000`
- Need to determine `poolId` from token pair
- Need to determine swap direction (zeroForOne)
- **Contract Address:** Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_AMM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` environment variable. Contract will be deployed and address provided.

### Issue #8: Pools List & Pool Details Component — Contract Integration
**Status:** ❌ PENDING  
**Labels:** `frontend`, `feature`, `pools`  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Depends on:** #6

**Description:**
Build UI to list pools by reading events or contract state; show pool details and balances. The UI exists but displays mock data.

**Current State:**

- Uses `getAllPools` and `getPool` functions (need implementation)
- Displays mock data

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Pools list page reads all pools from AMM contract events
- [ ] Each pool shows: token pair, fee tier, TVL, reserves
- [ ] Pool details page shows: full pool info, reserves, user's LP balance
- [ ] Real-time data updates when pools change
- [ ] Loading states handled
- [ ] Error states handled
- [ ] Links to pool detail pages work

**Technical Notes:**
- Read `PoolCreated` events from AMM contract

**Status:** ❌ PENDING  
**Labels:** `frontend`, `feature`, `liquidity`  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Depends on:** #6

**Description:**
Implement UI for adding and removing liquidity, with input validation and ratio calculation. The UI exists but needs contract integration.

**Current State:**

- Remove liquidity UI exists in pool details page
- Form validation exists
- Not connected to contract

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can select pool to add liquidity to
- [ ] User enters amounts for both tokens
- [ ] Component validates ratio matches pool ratio (for existing pools)
- [ ] Component calculates liquidity shares to mint
- [ ] User can submit add liquidity transaction
- [ ] Transaction sent to AMM contract's `addLiquidity` function
- [ ] User can view their LP balance
- [ ] User can remove liquidity by entering LP shares
- [ ] Component calculates token amounts to receive
- [ ] Remove liquidity transaction sent to AMM contract
- [ ] Success/failure feedback displayed

**Technical Notes:**
- For new pools: any ratio allowed
- For existing pools: must maintain ratio `amount0/amount1 = reserve0/reserve1`
- Liquidity calculation: `liquidity = min(amount0 * totalSupply / reserve0, amount1 * totalSupply / reserve1)`
- Need to approve tokens before adding liquidity
- Show user's current LP balance from `getLpBalance`
- **Contract Address:** Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_AMM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` environment variable. Contract will be deployed and address provided.

**Status:** ❌ PENDING  
**Labels:** `frontend`, `feature`, `pools`  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Depends on:** #6

**Description:**
Allow users to create new pools (token pair + initial liquidity) with deterministic ordering of token addresses. The UI exists but form submission not connected to contract.

**Current State:**
- Create pool page exists at `/pools/new`
- Form has token addresses, amounts, fee tier inputs
- Submit handler exists but needs contract integration

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User enters two token addresses
- [ ] Component automatically sorts tokens (token0 < token1)
- [ ] User enters initial liquidity amounts
- [ ] User selects fee tier (uses contract's defaultFeeBps)
- [ ] Component validates inputs
- [ ] User can submit create pool transaction
- [ ] Transaction sent to AMM contract's `createPool` function
- [ ] Pool ID calculated and displayed
- [ ] Success redirects to pool details page
- [ ] New pool appears in pools list

**Technical Notes:**
- Token addresses must be sorted: `token0 = min(tokenA, tokenB)`, `token1 = max(tokenA, tokenB)`
- Pool ID: `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(token0, token1, feeBps))`
- Contract uses `defaultFeeBps` from constructor (not user-selectable in current contract)
- Need to approve both tokens before creating pool
- Initial liquidity sets the starting price
- **Contract Address:** Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_AMM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` environment variable. Contract will be deployed and address provided.
